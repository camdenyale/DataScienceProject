        "This first dataset is from Kaggle.com, by Collin Smith. It is a CSV containing U.S. Dunkin Store Locations and has been last updated 3 years ago. Information was retrieved from Dunkin's location page at https://locations.dunkindonuts.com/en and was gathered with python using the Requests and BeautifulSoup libraries. Lat/Long data was retrieved using the Geopy library. Collin states that the NaNs in the Latitude and Longitude columns indicate the geocoder couldn't locate them. Each observation in this table is a different U.S. Dunkin store with data in variables such as location, hours of operation, and store features. In addition to the locations and hours of operation variables there is an int64 datatype row_id which is our index, and multiple boolean type variables such as drive_thru, mobile_order, dunkin_card, kcup, curbside-pickup,and has_baskin_robbins. Then the loc_lat and loc_long variables are of type  float64. All other variables like address, city, state, zip, phone, and hours are object and category datatypes. Overall this table has 20 columns and 9248 rows. We plan to use this dataset to answer 3 of our main questions: Regional disparities in store locations between Dunkin and Starbuks in the Northeast/Elsewhere, North/South, and East/West. We will tidy this dataset to focus on the nominal and numerical data of locations and quantity of stores. But we hope the boolean variables such as curbside_pickup can give us insight on marketing strategies when answering future questions.\n",

        "The second dataset we are working with is the Starbucks Store Location 2023: Coffee Giant Growth dataset from Omar Sobhy. We obtained this dataset on kaggle.com. This dataset was created to enable customers to find Starbucks locations near them. Customers, researchers, and students interested in learning more about Starbucks have utilized this dataset. This dataset has 13 columns and 25,601 rows. Columns include Brand, Store Number, Store Name, Ownership Type, Street Address, City, State/Province, Country, Postcode, Phone Number, Timezone, Longitude, and Latitude. Every column except for longitude and latitude is inferred as an object, meaning they are classification variables. Longitude and Latitude pandas are inferred as float64s, meaning they are numerical variables. Even though pandas infers them as objects and float64, we will set our variable datatypes below to ensure they work best with our project. This dataset will help us answer our 3 major questions. Are there any regional disparities between the Northeast vs Everywhere else, North vs South, and East vs West? This, alongside our Dunkin Stores dataset, will serve as the foundation of our project. As we discover the geospatial density of Starbucks and Dunkin, it will enable us to include additional datasets to answer our questions listed in the key questions section. Below, we will tidy this dataset by ensuring it adheres to all tidy data principles learned in class, as well as filtering for Starbucks locations only in the United States and dropping unwanted columns.\n",

        "Tidying this dataset consisted of mostly dropping unwanted columns from our dataframe. We made sure to preserve the original dataset, since some columns we wanted to filter out for now but might be useful later. For example, the boolean datatypes such as drive-thru or mobile-order, might be beneficial later for comparing marketing strategies, but for now we are using this dataset to understand the quantity and location of Dunkin stores in the United States. Next we wanted just one address row instead of two to comply with the attributes of tidy data we learned in class. Therefore we decided to join address_line_1 and address_line_2 using numpy. We used numpy so that we could exclude data under address_line_2 that was NaN, and append present data to address_line_1 in parenthesis. We considered re-ordering the hours for the days of the week, by creating a 'days' and 'hours' column. This did not work because it caused repetitions of our observations, and our purpose in this phase is to keep the location and row_id variables unique, therefore we decided to omit the hours and days of the week. Finally we removed the row_id column and instead renamed the index 'row_id' to eliminate redundance."

        "To tidy this dataset, we first started by dropping unwanted columns. We made sure to keep an original dataset stored in a dataframe to ensure that if we want the columns back for future use, we can utilize them. We decided we no longer needed \"Store Name\" or \"Ownership Type\" because they serve no direct correlation to our Dunkin dataset. The Store Number column is sufficient. We then needed to sort our data so it only includes Starbucks locations in the United States. We did this by finding all rows where the 'Country' column matched 'US'. This was a necessity because we are not comparing Starbucks and Dunkin locations worldwide, but nationally. We kept all other columns as they will help us in tracking our geospatial density. Pandas inferred our datatypes to be all objects except for Longitude and Latitude, which are float64. Pandas correctly inferred Longitude and Latitude, so we did not have to map new data types to those variables. Postcode, Phone Number, and Street Address, which were assigned the object datatype, stayed the same because they are unique values. We changed the variables Brand, Store Number, City, State/Province, Country, and Timezone to have a category datatype instead of an object. This was more efficient than treating them like an object because it is faster and takes less memory. Our final_starbucks_df holds our tidy dataset and will be used in our analysis throughout the remainder of this project."

        "We decided to do a bar graph as our first visual. We utilized the statistics of Starbucks and Dunkin locations by region we found above to see the distribution. This will be extremely useful in answering our question of Are there any significant regional disparities in the Northeast vs Everywhere else? Northeast vs West, and Northeast vs South. Starbucks is represented by the green bars while Dunkin is represented by the Orange bar. From this visual we can see some pretty extreme distributions of locations. For example, Starbucks has over 5,000 locations in the West but Dunkin has less than 500 locations in the West."
