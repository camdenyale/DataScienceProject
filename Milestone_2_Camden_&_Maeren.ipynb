        "This first dataset is from Kaggle.com, by Collin Smith. It is a CSV containing U.S. Dunkin Store Locations and has been last updated 3 years ago. Information was retrieved from Dunkin's location page at https://locations.dunkindonuts.com/en and was gathered with python using the Requests and BeautifulSoup libraries. Lat/Long data was retrieved using the Geopy library. Collin states that the NaNs in the Latitude and Longitude columns indicate the geocoder couldn't locate them. Each observation in this table is a different U.S. Dunkin store with data in variables such as location, hours of operation, and store features. In addition to the locations and hours of operation variables there is an int64 datatype row_id which is our index, and multiple boolean type variables such as drive_thru, mobile_order, dunkin_card, kcup, curbside-pickup,and has_baskin_robbins. Then the loc_lat and loc_long variables are of type  float64. All other variables like address, city, state, zip, phone, and hours are object and category datatypes. Overall this table has 20 columns and 9248 rows. We plan to use this dataset to answer 3 of our main questions: Regional disparities in store locations between Dunkin and Starbucks in the Northeast/Elsewhere, North/South, and East/West. We will tidy this dataset to focus on the nominal and numerical data of locations and quantity of stores. But we hope the boolean variables such as curbside_pickup can give us insight on marketing strategies when answering future questions.\n",

        "The second dataset we are working with is the Starbucks Store Location 2023: Coffee Giant Growth dataset from Omar Sobhy. We obtained this dataset on kaggle.com. This dataset was created to enable customers to find Starbucks locations near them. Customers, researchers, and students interested in learning more about Starbucks have utilized this dataset. This dataset has 13 columns and 25,601 rows. Columns include Brand, Store Number, Store Name, Ownership Type, Street Address, City, State/Province, Country, Postcode, Phone Number, Timezone, Longitude, and Latitude. Every column except for longitude and latitude is inferred as an object, meaning they are classification variables. Longitude and Latitude pandas are inferred as float64s, meaning they are numerical variables. Even though pandas infers them as objects and float64, we will set our variable datatypes below to ensure they work best with our project. This dataset will help us answer our 3 major questions. Are there any regional disparities between the Northeast vs Everywhere else, North vs South, and East vs West? This, alongside our Dunkin Stores dataset, will serve as the foundation of our project. As we discover the geospatial density of Starbucks and Dunkin, it will enable us to include additional datasets to answer our questions listed in the key questions section. Below, we will tidy this dataset by ensuring it adheres to all tidy data principles learned in class, as well as filtering for Starbucks locations only in the United States and dropping unwanted columns.\n",

For the purpose of our project, we will drop most of these columns to end up with just the index, NAME (city), STNAME (state name), and POPESTIMATE2020 (the population estimates for 2020) since 2020 is closest to the years our other data was gathered. When observing the pandas inferred dtypes, they were all accurate and will not need changing.

This dataset was created to allow easy, usable, and accurate manipulation of U.S Census data. Students, data analysts, and the general population have used this dataset for various calculations and projects. The dataset has 19 columns and over 32,000 rows.

However, we will drop many columns while cleaning our dataset to better align with our project goals. Pandas inferred all of our rows except Zip_Code, Lat, Lon, Mean, Median, Stdev which were either int64 or float64. This makes since these columns are numerical and the rest of the columns are classification columns. Even though pandas infered our variables like this, we will set our column datatypes below to ensure they work best with our project. This dataset will help us explore and analyze the relationship between household income and the locatins of Starbucks and Dunkin stores. Specifically, it will help us determine whether these stores are more concentrated in higher-income or lower-income neighborhoods based on average income. This will help us in our goal to discover if the average household income of a city elicit certain marketing strategies.

We will change the variables Brand, Store Number, City, State/Province, Country, and Timezone to have a category datatype instead of an object. This is more efficient than treating them like an object because it is faster and takes less memory.

Specifying regions is important to align with Objective 1: Geospatial Analysis and Regional Disparity. After using .map() and .value_count() to determine the total number of Dunkin locations in each region, we made a for loop to print each regions data. This helps us answer objective 1 because it shows the regional distribution of Dunkin locations. We can connect this to historical roots and market saturation in non-founding regions. For example, we see Dunkin has many more locations in the Northeast, its founding region, compared to less than 500 in the West, Starbucks founding region. By starting with these simple counts we can it gives us a foundation to do more complex analysis later on."

After using .map() and .value_count() to determine the total number of Starbucks locations in each region, we made a for loop to print each regions data. This helps us answer objective 1 because it shows the regional distribution of Starbucks locations. We can connect this to historical roots and market saturation in non-founding regions. For example, Starbucks has the most stores in the West, its founding region, and the least in the Northeast (Dunkin's founding region). By starting with these simple counts it gives us a foundation to do more complex analysis later on."

In other words, this calculates the percentage of total stores located in cities that successfully merged with the population estimates. This is crucial to check since our statistical metrics (like Store Density per capita above and our future Economic Correlation Model) rely on these matched pairs. The ouput shows that Dunkin's data coverage or match rate is 68.72% and Starbuck's match rate is 78.40%. Although both match rates are relatively high, this shows there is a sampling disparity between Starbucks and Dunkin."

        "This bar plot helps us answer Research Question 2: Does a city's median household income correlate with the presence of Starbucks and Dunkins? To create this visualization, we linked three datasets; Starbucks, Dunkin, and Median Household Income. The bar plot shows how the number of Dunkin and Starbucks locations vary across different city income levels. First we had to standardize the city column to ensure each city matched correctly across each dataset. To do this we converted strings to uppercase, removed any unwanted whitespace, fixed inconsistent capitalization, mapped state names to their abbreviations, and removed rows with missing values. If one city has multiple Dunkin or Starbucks locations, we will take the median. Then, we counted the number of Starbucks and Dunkin locations in each city and merged these counts with the corresponding median household income. When cities appeared multiple times in the income dataset, we took the median income for each city to avoid duplication. We then created income bins and calculated the average number of Starbucks and Dunkin stores per city within each income group. We are left with a clearly formatted bar plot that shows the distribution of Starbucks and Dunkin stores per income level."

Using this information, we can create a logistic regression model that will dive deeper into research question 2 and see exactly why there is a correlation.

Having a visualization allows for immediate interpretation of our data prior to creating our model. The grey section of this graph also highlights areas with direct competition. We can use this category to answer additional questions like:\n",

Normalization for our model will be done with our key variable Store Density per Capita, which accounts for the confounding variable of population size. This ensures that high store counts are not just resulting from large cities. The framework for this model will be implemented by grouping the city_analysis_df dataframe by the Region variable and calculating the mean store density. This directly leads to visualizations we have made like the regional bar chart. Our GCI and Top State Store Ratio variables have been previously calculated in our EDA section, and will provide quantitative proof for regional disparity."
